# The GHC team announced the first release candidate for the 9.0.1 release of
# GHC: https://discourse.haskell.org/t/glasgow-haskell-compiler-9-0-1-rc1-now-available/1706
#
# This is an example `stack.yaml` file that you can use to try out the release
# candidate. Save this file in your current directory and run `stack setup`.
# After that you should be able to use Stack as normal, including
# `stack exec ghci` and `stack build`.
#
# If for whatever reason you don't want to use Stack, you can download the
# official release tarballs at: https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/9.0.1-rc1/
#
# Read this blog post for a more thorough explanation of how to test GHC
# release candidates with Stack: https://taylor.fausak.me/2017/05/17/testing-ghc-release-candidates-with-stack/
#
# For more information about Stack configuration in general, please consult the
# Stack documentation: https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/yaml_configuration/

# First we have to tell Stack that we want to use this specific version of the
# compiler rather than whatever is set in the resolver. Note that the actual
# version number for GHC 9.0.1 RC1 is 9.0.0.20201227.
compiler: ghc-9.0.0.20201227

# Normally Stack makes sure that the compiler version number matches up to the
# minor (third) component. If we didn't tell Stack to match the compiler
# version exactly, it would use GHC 9.0.1 if you had it installed.
compiler-check: match-exact

# Now that we've told Stack which compiler to use, we have to tell it which
# packages to use via the resolver. You have a couple choices here:
#
# - Use a recent nightly resolver like `nightly-2020-12-14`. This includes a
#   wide range of packages that already work with GHC 8.10. Most of them will
#   probably also work with GHC 9.0.1 RC1. If they don't, you can override them
#   on a per-package basis.
#
# - Use the `ghc-9.0.0.20201227` resolver, which only includes "wired in"
#   packages that ship with GHC (like `bytestring`). Any other package you want
#   to use will have to go in `extra-deps`. This is technically more correct
#   but also very tedious to work with.
#
# We're going with the nightly resolver so that common packages like `aeson`
# are readily available.
resolver: nightly-2021-01-20

# This is where the magic happens. Stack doesn't know where to download release
# candidates from, so we have to tell it where they can be found. Fortunately
# this is pretty easy to do.
setup-info:

  # This key says that we're telling Stack where to get GHC. You can also tell
  # Stack where to get other stuff like MSYS2 (for Windows), but that's not
  # important for release candidates.
  ghc:

    # Each key here is an operating system that GHC and Stack support. They
    # support more (like FreeBSD and 32-bit Windows), but these three operating
    # systems cover most use-cases.
    linux64-tinfo6:

      # This key matches the compiler version we supplied at the top of the
      # file.

        # This is the only field that's strictly required. It's the URL that

        # a local file path! But the official source is the best choice for
        # most people.

        # tarball is the one we're expecting. We give it the expected file size
        # in bytes and the SHA1 hash of the file contents. If either of those
        # don't match, Stack will refuse to install it.
        #
        # If you don't care about security and just want a short `stack.yaml`,
        # you could remove these lines.
